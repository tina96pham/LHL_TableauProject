# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Wildlife strikes are common in aviation industry that pose a significant healh and safety risk as well as economical threat. The goal of the project is to create an interactive dashboard for wildlife risk assesment. The dashboard can be used to  better understanding of the economical effect of wildlife strikes to the aviantion industry. The interactive module will be tested by identify out of trend data and examine the root cause of the out of trend data.
## Process
### Examine the data set
- Create line graphs of cost overtime and number of wild trend overtime to gain initial insights to build the dashboard.
- Identifying trend or out of trend data for further analysis
### Detail analysis
- Identifying out of trend data and perform root cause analysis by creating bar chart and map of different variables in the dataset to identify the source of the outlier. The study can further provide insight for risk management.
- Questions to answer:
    * Trend in cost overtime?
    * Trend in number of strikes overtime? Time of year with high number of strikes?
    * Which wildlife species that has a high number of strike
    * Which wildlife species can cause significant damage?


## Results
The graph of cost of wildlife strikes over time from May 2000 to May 2015 display a significant increase in cost with $66 million spend in 2009 fiscal year. A study regarding the cause of the signicant high cost in 2009 compare to other years will help to derive a risk mitigation plan. There is an increase in the total number of wildlife strikes compare to the previous year. However the trend in number of strikes did not match with the trend in cost with an increase in number of strikes from 2009 but a decrease in cost. 
Upon inspection of the number strikes information, it forecasted that the number of strikes will continue to increase in the next two years. Peak season for strikes is in the August and most strike happen during approach. California has the highest number strikes overtime with gulls is the most common species to get strikes. 
The data for cost of wild life strike shows that there are canada goose strikes during the climb in new york in January 2009 that cause an approximate $41 million damage with the aircraft destroyed. There is also bald eagle strike around February 2009 in Colorado during climb that cause a substantial damage that cost an approximately $15 million. The two incidents cause the significant increase in  cost for 2009 fiscal year. 

## Challenges 
1. It was hard to start analyze data with no industry background. Research for some industry insight about the data is necessary to help understand the context and formulate the flow for the story with data.
2. Organization the dashboad is a challenge, there are very limited space but a lot of information that can be included. This can cause over usage of filter that connect to mutiple sheet on Tableau that can distract the audience.
3. The level of detailes and knowing how much information to drill. It is very important to set a project goal or insights from the dataset that need to be presented to audience to help stay on the right track.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Further drilling down on the level of detail of the dataset for more information. Time of day analysis can be performed to examine trend in wildlife strikes and time of day to enhance air traffic control. Analysis on airport with frequent impact from wildlife strikes can be performed to help with risk mitigation decision.
